<!-- error.vue will be loaded whenever the app 
throws an error, like a 404 error. It´s important to notice that
this file should always be called error.vue -->

<!-- 1) Create a template and add inside whatever
you want your error message to be  -->
<!-- 2) Testing by going to /users and enter
in the input something other than a number.
Click the button, and the content of error.vue
should be displayed -->
<template>
<h1>An error occurred, we´re sorry!</h1>
</template>
